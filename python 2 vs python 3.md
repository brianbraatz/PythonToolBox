# what is the difference between python 2 and python 3 - Google Search
he primary difference between Python 2 and Python 3 is that Python 3 uses Unicode for all strings by default, while Python 2 uses ASCII encoding, leading to significant changes in how strings are handled, along with other syntax differences like the "print" statement being a function in Python 3 and a statement in Python 2, and different behavior for integer division; essentially, Python 3 is considered a more modern and improved version with better Unicode support and cleaner syntax compared to Python 2, making it the recommended choice for new projects.
