an you make a table of the pros and cons of each approach and include a column with a link to the homepage

Sure! Here's a table comparing the pros and cons of several popular Python web frameworks, along with links to their homepages:

|Framework|Pros|Cons|Homepage|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Django**|Batteries-included, robust security, extensive documentation|Steeper learning curve, less flexible|Django|
|**Flask**|Lightweight, easy to learn, flexible|Limited functionality out-of-the-box, less secure|Flask|
|**FastAPI**|High performance, automatic documentation, supports async code|Smaller community, less mature|FastAPI|
|**AIOHTTP**|Asynchronous, supports WebSockets, extensive feature set|Steeper learning curve, debugging can be challenging|AIOHTTP|
|**Bottle**|Simple, lightweight, easy to deploy|Limited functionality, less suitable for large applications|Bottle|
|**CherryPy**|Minimalistic, easy to integrate, supports multiple HTTP servers|Less popular, smaller community|CherryPy|
|**Web2py**|Easy to learn, built-in web-based IDE, good for beginners|Performance issues, less flexible|Web2py|
|**Tornado**|High performance, supports async code, good for long polling|Smaller community, less mature|Tornado|
|**Zappa**|Serverless, easy to deploy, integrates with AWS Lambda|Limited to AWS, less control over infrastructure|Zappa|
|**AWS Chalice**|Serverless, integrates with AWS services, easy to deploy|Limited to AWS, less control over infrastructure|AWS Chalice|
