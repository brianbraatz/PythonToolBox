## Why JSON Schema?

While JSON is probably the most popular format for exchanging data, JSON Schema is the vocabulary that enables JSON data consistency, validity, and interoperability at scale.

### Streamline testing and validation

Simplify your validation logic to reduce your code’s complexity and save time on development. Define constraints for your data structures to catch and prevent errors, inconsistencies, and invalid data.

### Exchange data seamlessly

Establish a common language for data exchange, no matter the scale or complexity of your project. Define precise validation rules for your data structures to create shared understanding and increase interoperability across different systems and platforms.

### Document your data

Create a clear, standardized representation of your data to improve understanding and collaboration among developers, stakeholders, and collaborators.

### Vibrant tooling ecosystem

Adopt JSON Schema with an expansive range of community-driven tools, libraries, and frameworks across many programming languages.
